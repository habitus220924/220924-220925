### how do you arrive at and â€˜solveâ€™ musical problems?

### where do daydreams fit into your methodology?

### how do you daydream?

*a big part of trying to solve musical problems is to stop trying to solve the problem*

*listen to others trying to solve their own problems*

*time*

*engaging in activities that allow you to give up attachment to the outcome*

*daydreaming as a way to disconnect*

*when do you dive deeper and when do you clear yourself out?*

*how often are the feelings negative? and how can depression or anger or frustration be a good cue for when you need to shift gears?*

*external-centric vs internal-only â€” spike! maybe the solution is through hitting it harder*

*what is a musical problem vs technical problem? if everything is part of the process of making music (even breakfast!), then the lines get gleefully blurry*

*coffee shop as space of inspiration*

*how many ways / times do solutions come to you as soon as you stop thinking?*

*creating problems on purpose â€” make the weirdest sounding thing, go toward the outer-most edge, and then let it marinate toward an approachable solution*

*what happens when you make a new, harder problem? does it help make the original problem easier to solve?*

### PDCA: a version of the scientific method

- plan: build hypothesis / plan experiment
- do: do the experiment
- check: results
- act / adjust: often, youâ€™ll not get exactly what you expected (by design, cuz itâ€™s an experiment) â€” but you constantly check and adjust your hypothesis as a method of learning
    - expect something *other* than what you were expecting â€” continuous learning

### Resources

- with open source, there are solutions already available for the community to leverage
- lines (https:llllllll.co)
- [norns.community](http://norns.community) (https://norns.community)
- monome website ([https://monome.org](https://monome.org/))
    - api: [https://monome.org/docs/norns/api/index.html](https://monome.org/docs/norns/api/index.html)
    - norns studies and all the other studies
    - GitHub (norns and lua scripts + gobs of other script examples)
        - finding new inspiration in solutions to questions you didnâ€™t even have on your radar â€” cyclical inspiration through resource-digging
- the internet
- discord: [https://discord.gg/MQtJ8rWVUa](https://discord.gg/MQtJ8rWVUa)

### research!

*30 minutes*

**frequency detection (w/ norns)**

### ðŸ’­daydreamðŸ’­

*15 minutes*

- *controlling synths with the pitch of my voice*
- *Department of Homeland Security â€” pulling voices out of radios*
    - aural / spectral signatures

### conclusion

*when solving a problem or imagining solutions:*

- what do i know?
- what do i still need to learn?
- what am i going to do to learn the thing / close the gap in my understanding?

### notation exercise

- capture/release/wait
- there are different levels of specificity in the notations
- what is the most salient feature you are listening for to detect?
- what if there are too many frequencies so it becomes hard to detect a single frequency?
- shifting based on overtones in a sound
- are these instructions for people or a machine or both?
- it is nice to get bogged down in how you are going to implement something and more what you want to implement.
- writing real-time instructions to a machine for how to play along with a person performing.
