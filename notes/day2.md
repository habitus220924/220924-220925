# welcome!

what do you experience when writing a norns script and/or composing/performing a piece of music?

- initial excitement — *‘oh, i can do this with norns!!’.* or trying on someone else’s perspective through their scripts.
    - followed by fear — asking questions, embarrassment. *but folks on lines are really nice and it swings back to excitement again.*
- composing + script writing are on the same side of the continuum. performance is different. *improvisation as play with the composition of the system.* scripting is composing the system with which one performs. composing as problem solving, tinkering, satisfying.
    - live-coding is more performance-oriented — *i try not to solve any problems when performing, just let music flow. brain off, ears on.*
- when programming, more decisions to make — during performance, those decisions are either already made or there isn’t time to work on them in the moment. just *act*.
- *momentum —* burst of energy, which can feel out of control. seeking for the *sweet spot.*
- composing — childlike discovery. like having a baby daughter and giving her *anything* and she just dives in whole heartedly.
    - norns developers as *authors*, and scripts as a collected library.
    - *discover* what you can do with a script before reading the instructions, then concretize through manual or chats.
- *shock* when you see the thing actually works. you spend all this time preparing and building and the moment it turns into sound gives a temporal shock of ‘i created something!!’

## We just *can’t* investigate everything, and for that reason we are forced to rest content with assumption. If I want the door to turn, the hinges must stay put (On Certainty 341–343) — ***Wittgenstein***

- when touching a problem for the first time, it’s easy to feel energized / motivated by the DEEP zoom in
- you have to be content with not understanding *everything* along the way — abstractions really help
    - you don’t have to deal with the audio server if you don’t want to, that’s where Crone comes in
- this is applicable to every type of creation — you have to forget things in order to actually experience it. *forest for the trees*. the important part is that there’s a table here, not the knot or the totality of all the other interesting things
- *the possibility* of what you investigate, whatever you do choose, is infinite. *where you want to go* is unlimited — the important question is where do you put the energy when you have a limited amount of time?
- *i think, therefore i am —* you can’t approach the world without assumptions. there’s always a thing underneath, which isn’t moving.
    - how do you uncover the assumptions and turn those into what you’re questioning? then there’s another layer of stuff that isn’t moving — turn the hinges into questions.
- *if memory didn’t exist, would we be capable of anything?* you can go forward with some existing assumptions, but the challenge is to not be overwhelmed by the possibilities.
- *what am i going to investigate today?*
- getting caught in a trap of containment vs. useful limitations / boundaries on the scope
    - ‘chain your heart through your soul’
    - there’s a feel to it — if they’re useful or not useful depends on the moment. *methods of input*

## concrete practice

with these concepts in mind…

continue coding from where you left off yesterday

*make the smallest change imaginable and recompile frequently to always know what changed and what needs to be fixed when testing a script in development*
